Mapsforge rendertheme for LocusMap 3 or 4. Tested with OpenAndroMaps. LoMaps V4+ support with minor issues.<br>

Main goals of the theme are:

- Extensive configurability with a useful default and also a few presets
- Good overview especially in low zoom levels
- Friendly and useful coloring
- Useful display of national/intl. Hiking/Cycling/MTB routes.

All power to the user. With this theme you can do unique things, like hiding the road network and only displaying the railways.
